There are 3 main pillars:
1. Ubiquitous language
	- The process of building a common language (between engineers and business)
2. Strategic design
	- The process of mapping out the business domain and bounded contexts
3. Tactical design
	- The process of defining the specifics of the design (entities, aggregates, value objects).

## Ubiquitous language
= overlap of the language engineers and domain experts use

Important that engineers challenge domain experts (especially in the edge cases) such that the definitions are sounded and consistent.

The established language should be used inside the code itself.

Ubiquitous language should always be applied only to one bounded context.
- One word might mean something else in different contexts and that's okay.
- The language should be rigorous, it shouldn't lose its meaning.
	- Customer might mean different things in different contexts, don't try to merge the meanings because we are losing rigorousness.
