There are 3 main pillars:
1. Ubiquitous language
	- The process of building a common language (between engineers and business)
2. Strategic design
	- The process of mapping out the business domain and bounded contexts
3. Tactical design
	- The process of defining the specifics of the design (entities, aggregates, value objects).
